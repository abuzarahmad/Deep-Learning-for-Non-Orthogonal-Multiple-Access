# Deep-Learning-for-Non-Orthogonal-Multiple-Access

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is one of the most promising radio access techniques in next-generation wireless communications. Compared to orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), which is the current de facto standard orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technique, NOMA offers a set of desirable potential benefits, such as enhanced spectrum efficiency, reduced latency with high reliability, and massive connectivity. The baseline idea of NOMA is to serve multiple users using the same resource in terms of time, frequency, and space.

This is an implementation of NOMA using deep learning framework.
